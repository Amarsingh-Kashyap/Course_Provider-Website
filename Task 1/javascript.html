      <h1>Javascript Tutorial</h1>
<br>
<img src="img/img3_card.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300"> <br>
<br>
<p><b>JavaScript</b> is a lightweight, interpreted <b>programming</b> language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. <b>JavaScript</b> is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.</p>
<h2>Why to Learn Javascript</h2>
<p><b>Javascript</b> is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Javascript:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Javascript is the most popular <b>programming language</b> in the world and that makes it a programmer’s great choice. Once you learnt Javascript, it helps you developing great front-end as well as back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser and so to learn Javascript you really do not need any special environment setup. For example Chrome, Mozilla Firefox , Safari and every browser you know as of today, supports Javascript.</p></li>
<li><p>Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast websites. You can develop your website with a console like look and feel and give your users the best Graphical User Experience.</p></li>
<li><p>JavaScript usage has now extended to mobile app development, desktop app development, and game development. This opens many opportunities for you as Javascript Programmer.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to high demand, there is tons of job growth and high pay for those who know JavaScript. You can navigate over to different job sites to see what having JavaScript skills looks like in the job market.</p></li>
<li><p>Great thing about Javascript is that you will find tons of frameworks and Libraries already developed which can be used directly in your software development to reduce your time to market.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There could be 1000s of good reasons to learn Javascript Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn any <b>programming language</b>, not only Javascript, you just need to code, and code and finally code until you become expert.</p>
<h2>Hello World using Javascript</h2>
<p>Just to give you a little excitement about <b>Javascript programming</b>, I'm going to give you a small conventional Javascript Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link</p>
<div class="demo-view">
<a href="http://tpcg.io/aMKLYm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>
</div>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;   
      &lt;script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript"&gt;
         &lt;!--
            document.write("Hello World!")
         //--&gt;
      &lt;/script&gt;      
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>There are many useful <b>Javascript frameworks</b> and libraries available:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Angular</p></li>
<li><p>React</p></li>
<li><p>jQuery</p></li>
<li><p>Vue.js</p></li>
<li><p>Ext.js</p></li>
<li><p>Ember.js</p></li>
<li><p>Meteor</p></li>
<li><p>Mithril</p></li>
<li><p>Node.js</p></li>
<li><p>Polymer</p></li>
<li><p>Aurelia</p></li>
<li><p>Backbone.js</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is really impossible to give a complete list of all the available Javascript frameworks and libraries. The Javascript world is just too large and too much new is happening.</p>
<h2>Applications of Javascript Programming</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, <b>Javascript</b> is one of the most widely used <b>programming languages</b> (Front-end as well as Back-end). It has it's presence in almost every area of software development. I'm going to list few of them here:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Client side validation</b> - This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the server and Javascript plays an important role in validting those inputs at front-end itself.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Manipulating HTML Pages</b> - Javascript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly. This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily using javascript and modify your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><b>User Notifications</b> - You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages to give different types of notifications to your website visitors.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Back-end Data Loading</b> - Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading back-end data while you are doing some other processing. This really gives an amazing experience to your website visitors.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Presentations</b> - JavaScript also provides the facility of creating presentations which gives website look and feel. JavaScript provides RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build a web-based slide presentations.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Server Applications</b> - Node JS is built on Chrome's Javascript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications. This is an event based library which helps in developing very sophisticated server applications including Web Servers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This list goes on, there are various areas where millions of software developers are happily using Javascript to develop great websites and others softwares.</p>
<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>This tutorial has been prepared for JavaScript beginners to help them understand the basic functionality of JavaScript to build dynamic web pages and web applications.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>For this <b>Javascript tutorial</b>, it is assumed that the reader have a prior knowledge of HTML coding. It would help if the reader had some prior exposure to object-oriented programming concepts and a general idea on creating online applications.</p><div id="load">

<p>JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the <b>&lt;script&gt;... &lt;/script&gt;</b> HTML tags in a web page.</p>
<p>You can place the <b>&lt;script&gt;</b> tags, containing your JavaScript, anywhere within your web page, but it is normally recommended that you should keep it within the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> tags.</p>
<p>The &lt;script&gt; tag alerts the browser program to start interpreting all the text between these tags as a script. A simple syntax of your JavaScript will appear as follows.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
&lt;script ...&gt;
   JavaScript code
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>The script tag takes two important attributes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Language</b> &minus; This attribute specifies what scripting language you are using. Typically, its value will be javascript. Although recent versions of HTML (and XHTML, its successor) have phased out the use of this attribute.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Type</b> &minus; This attribute is what is now recommended to indicate the scripting language in use and its value should be set to "text/javascript".</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So your JavaScript segment will look like &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
&lt;script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript"&gt;
   JavaScript code
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<h2>Your First JavaScript Code</h2>
<p>Let us take a sample example to print out "Hello World". We added an optional HTML comment that surrounds our JavaScript code. This is to save our code from a browser that does not support JavaScript. The comment ends with a "//--&gt;". Here "//" signifies a comment in JavaScript, so we add that to prevent a browser from reading the end of the HTML comment as a piece of JavaScript code. Next, we call a function <b>document.write</b> which writes a string into our HTML document.</p>
<p>This function can be used to write text, HTML, or both. Take a look at the following code.</p>
<div class="demo-view">
<a href="http://tpcg.io/aMKLYm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>
</div>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;   
      &lt;script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript"&gt;
         &lt;!--
            document.write("Hello World!")
         //--&gt;
      &lt;/script&gt;      
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>This code will produce the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Hello World!
</pre> 
<h2>Whitespace and Line Breaks</h2>
<p>JavaScript ignores spaces, tabs, and newlines that appear in JavaScript programs. You can use spaces, tabs, and newlines freely in your program and you are free to format and indent your programs in a neat and consistent way that makes the code easy to read and understand.</p>
<h2>Semicolons are Optional</h2>
<p>Simple statements in JavaScript are generally followed by a semicolon character, just as they are in C, C++, and Java. JavaScript, however, allows you to omit this semicolon if each of your statements are placed on a separate line. For example, the following code could be written without semicolons.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript"&gt;
   &lt;!--
      var1 = 10
      var2 = 20
   //--&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>But when formatted in a single line as follows, you must use semicolons &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript"&gt;
   &lt;!--
      var1 = 10; var2 = 20;
   //--&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; It is a good programming practice to use semicolons.</p>
<h2>Case Sensitivity</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. This means that the language keywords, variables, function names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.</p>
<p>So the identifiers <b>Time</b> and <b>TIME</b> will convey different meanings in JavaScript.</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b> &minus; Care should be taken while writing variable and function names in JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Comments in JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript supports both C-style and C++-style comments, Thus &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by JavaScript.</p></li>
<li><p>Any text between the characters /* and */ is treated as a comment. This may span multiple lines.</p></li>
<li><p>JavaScript also recognizes the HTML comment opening sequence &lt;!--. JavaScript treats this as a single-line comment, just as it does the // comment.</p></li>
<li><p>The HTML comment closing sequence --&gt; is  not recognized by JavaScript so it should be written as //--&gt;.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following example shows how to use comments in JavaScript.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript"&gt;
   &lt;!--
      // This is a comment. It is similar to comments in C++
   
      /*
      * This is a multi-line comment in JavaScript
      * It is very similar to comments in C Programming
      */
   //--&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<h2>What is an Operator?</h2> 
<p>Let us take a simple expression <b>4 + 5 is equal to 9</b>. Here 4 and 5 are called <b>operands</b> and ‘+’ is called the <b>operator</b>. JavaScript supports the following types of operators.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
<li>Comparison Operators</li>
<li>Logical (or Relational) Operators</li>
<li>Assignment Operators</li>
<li>Conditional (or ternary) Operators</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets have a look on all operators one by one.</p>
<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
<p>JavaScript supports the following arithmetic operators &minus;</p>
<p>Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;width:9%;">Sr.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Operator &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">1</td>
<td><p><b>+ (Addition)</b></p>
<p>Adds two operands</p>
<p><b>Ex:</b> A + B will give 30</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">2</td>
<td><p><b>- (Subtraction)</b></p>
<p>Subtracts the second operand from the first</p>
<p><b>Ex:</b> A - B will give -10</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">3</td>
<td><p><b>* (Multiplication)</b></p>
<p>Multiply both operands</p>
<p><b>Ex:</b> A * B will give 200</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">4</td>
<td><p><b>/ (Division)</b></p>
<p>Divide the numerator by the denominator</p>
<p><b>Ex:</b> B / A will give 2</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">5</td>
<td><p><b>% (Modulus)</b></p>
<p>Outputs the remainder of an integer division</p>
<p><b>Ex:</b> B % A will give 0</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">6</td>
<td><p><b>++ (Increment)</b></p>
<p>Increases an integer value by one</p>
<p><b>Ex:</b> A++ will give 11</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">7</td>
<td><p><b>-- (Decrement)</b></p>
<p>Decreases an integer value by one</p>
<p><b>Ex:</b> A-- will give 9</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Addition operator (+) works for Numeric as well as Strings. e.g. "a" + 10 will give "a10".</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Operator</h2>
<p>We will discuss two operators here that are quite useful in JavaScript: the <b>conditional operator</b> (? :) and the <b>typeof operator</b>.</p>
<h3>Conditional Operator (? :)</h3>
<p>The conditional operator first evaluates an expression for a true or false value and then executes one of the two given statements depending upon the result of the evaluation.</p>

<h2>typeof Operator</h2>
<p>The <b>typeof</b> operator is a unary operator that is placed before its single operand, which can be of any type. Its value is a string indicating the data type of the operand.</p>
<p>The <i>typeof</i> operator evaluates to "number", "string", or "boolean" if its operand is a number, string, or boolean value and returns true or false based on the evaluation.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the return values for the <b>typeof</b> Operator.</p>

<h2>What is an Event ?</h2>
<p>JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page.</p>
<p>When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.</p>
<p>Developers can use these events to execute JavaScript coded responses, which cause buttons to close windows, messages to be displayed to users, data to be validated, and virtually any other type of response imaginable.</p>
<p>Events are a part of the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 and every HTML element contains a set of events which can trigger JavaScript Code.</p>
<p>Please go through this small tutorial for a better understanding <a href="/html/html_events_ref.htm">HTML Event Reference</a>. Here we will see a few examples to understand a relation between Event and JavaScript &minus;</p>
<h2>onclick Event Type</h2>
<p>This is the most frequently used event type which occurs when a user clicks the left button of his mouse. You can put your validation, warning etc., against this event type.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Try the following example.</p>
<div class="demo-view">
<a href="http://tpcg.io/iyeFLu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>
</div>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;html&gt;

      &lt;script type = "text/javascript"&gt;
         &lt;!--
            function sayHello() {
               alert("Hello World")
            }
         //--&gt;
      &lt;/script&gt;      
   &lt;/head&gt;
   
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Click the following button and see result&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;form&gt;
         &lt;input type = "button" onclick = "sayHello()" value = "Say Hello" /&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;      
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<h3>Output</h3>
<h2>onsubmit Event Type</h2>
<p><b>onsubmit</b> is an event that occurs when you try to submit a form. You can put your form validation against this event type.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following example shows how to use onsubmit. Here we are calling a <b>validate()</b> function before submitting a form data to the webserver. If <b>validate()</b> function returns true, the form will be submitted, otherwise it will not submit the data.</p>
<p>Try the following example.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;   
      &lt;script type = "text/javascript"&gt;
         &lt;!--
            function validation() {
               all validation goes here
               .........
               return either true or false
            }
         //--&gt;
      &lt;/script&gt;      
   &lt;/head&gt;
   
   &lt;body&gt;   
      &lt;form method = "POST" action = "t.cgi" onsubmit = "return validate()"&gt;
         .......
         &lt;input type = "submit" value = "Submit" /&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;      
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<h2>onmouseover and onmouseout</h2>
<p>These two event types will help you create nice effects with images or even with text as well. The <b>onmouseover</b> event triggers when you bring your mouse over any element and the <b>onmouseout</b> triggers when you move your mouse out from that element. Try the following example.</p>
<div class="demo-view">
<a href="http://tpcg.io/o3Bzlo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>

         &lt;!--
            function over() {
               document.write ("Mouse Over");
            }            
            function out() {
               document.write ("Mouse Out");
            }            
         //--&gt;
      &lt;/script&gt;      
   &lt;/head&gt;
   
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Bring your mouse inside the division to see the result:&lt;/p&gt;      
      &lt;div onmouseover = "over()" onmouseout = "out()"&gt;
         &lt;h2&gt; This is inside the division &lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;         
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
